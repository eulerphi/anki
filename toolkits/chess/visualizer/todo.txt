-Scrollable log
-Simplify coords by only showing a1 and/or h8?
-Better UX for movement, marks, and arrows?
    -Select squares and then select action?
        -Maybe show additional colors after selecting action?
            -This is optional interaction for the user
        -e.g. selected sq1, sq2 would show actions:
            -move (if valid)
            -arrows: sq1 -> sq2
            -marks (green)
            -marks (red)
        -e.g. selected sq1, sq2, s3 would show actions:
            -arrows: sq1 -> sq2, sq2 -> sq3
            -arrows (same src): sq1 -> sq2, sq1 -> sq3
            -marks (green)
            -marks (red)
    -Multitouch for movement?
    -Apple pen for marks and arrows?
-Properly handle small screens
    -Properly size side buttons
